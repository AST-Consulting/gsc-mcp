# Google Analytics MCP Server

GA-MCP (Google Analytics Management Control Panel) is a lightweight Node.js package that provides developers with a structured interface to interact with Google Analytics APIs. It simplifies common GA tasks like querying analytics reports, managing properties, audiences, and moreâ€”making it ideal for data analysts, developers, and marketing teams looking to automate reporting and analytics workflows. [MCP standard](https://modelcontextprotocol.wiki/en/introduction).

## Features

- Fetch and analyze GA performance data (sessions, users, pageviews, conversions)
- Manage properties, data streams, and conversion events
- Query custom dimensions and metrics
- Access account hierarchies and property configurations
- Export data for dashboards or further analysis
- OAuth2 authentication with access and refresh tokens
- Lightweight, secure, and highly configurable

## MCP Tools

- `get_reports`: Get analytics reports data for specified metrics and dimensions
- `list_accounts`: List all Google Analytics accounts
- `list_properties`: List properties for a Google Analytics account
- `list_data_streams`: List data streams for a property
- `list_custom_dimensions`: List custom dimensions for a property
- `list_custom_metrics`: List custom metrics for a property
- `list_conversion_events`: List conversion events for a property

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18 or later
- Google OAuth2 credentials (Client ID and Client Secret)
- Valid Google Analytics access and refresh tokens

### Authentication Setup

1. **Create OAuth2 Credentials:**
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create or select a project
   - Enable the Google Analytics API
   - Go to "Credentials" â†’ "Create Credentials" â†’ "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"
   - Configure the consent screen and choose the appropriate application type:
     
     **Option A: Web Application** (Recommended)
     - Select "Web application"
     - Add `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback` to "Authorized redirect URIs"
     
     **Option B: Desktop Application**
     - Select "Desktop application"
     - No redirect URI configuration needed (uses out-of-band flow)

2. **Generate Access and Refresh Tokens:**
   - Use the included helper script: `npm run oauth-helper`
   - Or use [Google OAuth2 Playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/) with your client credentials
   - Or implement your own OAuth2 flow

### Quick Setup Workflow

```bash
# 1. Set up environment file
npm run setup-env

# 2. Edit .env with your OAuth2 Client ID and Secret (from step 1 above)

# 3. Generate tokens
npm run oauth-helper

# 4. Copy the generated tokens to your .env file

# 5. Build and start
npm run build
node dist/index.js
```

### Installation

Clone this repository and install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
# or
npm install
```

### Build

```bash
pnpm build
# or
npm run build
```

### Configuration Environment Variables

**Option 1: Using .env file (Recommended)**

Set up your environment file:

```bash
npm run setup-env
# This creates .env from the template
# Edit .env file with your actual credentials
```

**Option 2: Using export commands**

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_oauth2_client_id
export GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_oauth2_client_secret
export GOOGLE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
export GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_refresh_token
```

### Start

Start the MCP server:

```bash
node dist/index.js
```

### Integrate with Cursor

To use this MCP server with [Cursor](https://www.cursor.so), add a `.cursor/mcp.json` file to your project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ga-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "ga-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID": "your_oauth2_client_id",
        "GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET": "your_oauth2_client_secret",
        "GOOGLE_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your_access_token",
        "GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN": "your_refresh_token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Integrate with VSCode

To use this MCP server with VSCode, add a `.vscode/mcp.json` file to your project root:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "ga-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "ga-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID": "your_oauth2_client_id",
        "GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET": "your_oauth2_client_secret",
        "GOOGLE_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your_access_token",
        "GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN": "your_refresh_token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This configuration enables VSCode to recognize and manage the Google Analytics MCP server automatically.

This configuration enables Cursor to recognize and manage the Google Analytics MCP server automatically.

## Token Refresh

The MCP server automatically handles token refresh using the provided refresh token. If the access token expires, it will be automatically refreshed during API calls.

## Troubleshooting

### "The redirect URI... can only be used by a Client ID for native application"

This error occurs when you have a **Web application** OAuth client but are using the out-of-band redirect URI. Solutions:

**Solution 1: Use Web Application (Recommended)**
1. In Google Cloud Console, edit your OAuth client
2. Add `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback` to "Authorized redirect URIs"
3. Keep `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/auth/callback` in your `.env` file

**Solution 2: Switch to Desktop Application**
1. Create a new OAuth client and select "Desktop application"
2. Set `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob` in your `.env` file
